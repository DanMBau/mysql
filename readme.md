**Bamazon!**

An online shop app with *mySQL* integration.

After starting the app the user sees the inventory of the shop displayed as a table in the terminal.

They the get prompted which item they want to purchase, or if they would like to exit the program by pressing **"x"**.

The next prompt inquires the user about how many of the selected item they would like to purchase.

Following that the *mySQL* database gets updated with the adjusted quantities.

Here is a [link](https://github.com/DanMBau/mysql/blob/master/Screen%20Recording.mov) to a video of the app running.
